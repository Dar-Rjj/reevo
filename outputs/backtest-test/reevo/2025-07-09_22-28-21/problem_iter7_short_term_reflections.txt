Focus on adaptive weighting, normalize inputs, cap outliers, and combine price/volume dynamics with volatility adjustments.
Focus on simplicity, normalization, and adaptive weighting. Use rolling windows, momentum, volume ratios, and regime detection for robust, interpretable alphas.
Focus on dynamic normalization, adaptive weighting, regime-aware components, and robustness to outliers and instability.
Incorporate volatility weighting, normalize signals, clip outliers, use dynamic lookback windows, and blend momentum with volume anomalies for robust alpha factors.
