```python

    # Calculate the relative difference between close price and the weighted average of open, high, low, and close
    w_open = 0.2
    w_high = 0.25
    w_low = 0.15

    # Compute the factor as the normalized difference between close and the weighted average
    factor = (df['close'] - weighted_avg) / (df['high'] - df['low'] + 1e-7)
