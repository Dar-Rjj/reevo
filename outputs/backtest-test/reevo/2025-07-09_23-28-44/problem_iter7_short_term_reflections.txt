Focus on dynamic normalization, volume-weighted momentum, adaptive volatility windows, and interpretable rank-based component weighting.
Focus on dynamic normalization, volume-weighted momentum, and adaptive volatility windows for robust, interpretable signals.
Focus on dynamic normalization, adaptive weighting, and interpretable components. Prioritize robustness against outliers and regime shifts.
Incorporate dynamic weighting, adaptive lookback periods, and cross-sectional normalization for robustness.
