```python
import pandas as pd

def heuristics_v2(df):
    # Calculate the price change using close prices
    price_change = df['close'].diff()
    
    # Calculate the previous close price
    previous_close = df['close'].shift(1)
    
    # Divide the price change by the previous close to get the momentum
    momentum = price_change / previous_close
    
    # Return the momentum as a pandas Series
    return momentum
```
