Incorporate local neighborhood structure, mutual proximity, and adaptive sparsity for enhanced heuristic guidance.
Incorporate local density, normalize row-wise, penalize high-attractiveness nodes, and apply adaptive sparsity.
Incorporate local density normalization, use adaptive thresholds, and emphasize sparse, short edges.
Incorporate local and global edge importance, normalize preferences per node, use power scaling for emphasis, and sparsify with adaptive thresholds.
Incorporate local density, normalize by node-specific averages, and balance sparsity with inverse distance for better heuristic guidance.
Incorporate local density, prioritize shorter edges, and sparsify effectively.
Incorporate degree normalization, local comparisons, and sparsity via percentile thresholds for balanced edge prioritization.
Incorporate variance normalization, relative node importance, and symmetric edge evaluation for stronger heuristic guidance.
Focus on centrality measures, normalize properly, avoid heuristics that cause imbalance or overflow, and adjust thresholds for sparsity.
Incorporate local structure, mutual relationships, and adaptive sparsification to enhance heuristic guidance.
