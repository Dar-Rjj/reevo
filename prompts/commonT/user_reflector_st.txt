Below are two {func_name} trees for {problem_desc}
{func_desc}

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Worse tree]
{worse_tree}

[Better tree]
{better_tree}

You respond with some hints for designing better heuristics, based on the two code versions and using less than 20 words.
